TODO
====

###Non-monotone partitioning edge cases
* Fails when diagonals are created that are not bound within the polygon (fixed)
* Function that assigns vertices to partitions is naive and does not work in many cases

###Different colors
* Add ability to change the color of polygons

###Outline mode
* Add ability to draw outlines of polygons instead of solids. This will be useful for debugging
* Possibly also add vertex mode that only draws vertices
